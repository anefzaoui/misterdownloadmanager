## Version 0.5.0

Everything below ships together, in version 0.5.0.

### Done

- ✅ Menus on compositors that animate windows (Hyprland): no border and no slide-in, and going from
  title to title moves one window, so nothing fades; the reporter confirmed it
  ([#277](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/277))
- ✅ A very slow first window on Windows: MDM draws with Direct3D 12 by default and keeps it through
  a slow start ([#57](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/57))
- ✅ A crash on Linux as Download File Info opens
  ([#48](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/48))
- ✅ Linux on GNOME Wayland: right-click menus open where you click, and windows fit their buttons
  ([#29](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/29))
- ✅ Windows 11 Insider builds: no black band across the top of menus, the drop target, the
  progress window and the windows whose title bar MDM draws (the style themes); the reporter
  confirmed it ([#208](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/208))
- ✅ The progress window's Download status tab: as much room above its first row as below its
  last; where the server is says "this computer" or "the local network", each with its icon
- ✅ **View → Interface size**: every window larger, 100 % to 200 %, with Ctrl + / Ctrl − / Ctrl 0
  as in a browser; a window larger than the screen scrolls. Sharper text on Windows (part of
  [#262](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/262))
- ✅ Windows: **View → Text → Smooth** draws the text anti-aliased at its own size, not as
  thick, hard-edged whole-pixel letters that read badly on a 1440p screen; **Classic**, the
  default, keeps the hinted look MDM had. **Interface size** gains 110 %, 115 % and 120 % between 100 % and
  125 %
- ✅ Windows: sharp, evenly spaced text at every interface size: letters no longer run together
  or drift apart ([#323](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/323),
  [#334](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/334))
- ✅ Linux: Update now asks the package manager which package MDM is; a copy installed by
  another package manager (pacman) is left to the system's updates, with a plain message
- ✅ Linux: the .deb and .rpm install the browsers' host files for everyone and remove them on
  uninstall, so nothing is left in the home folders for Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi and
  Firefox (the Snap too); the guide says what the AppImage and the tar.gz leave, and how to remove
  it ([#266](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/266))
- ✅ Linux: menus and drop-down lists open under what was clicked on tiling compositors (sway)
  too, through XWayland, as on GNOME and KDE
  ([#267](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/267))
- ✅ Linux: a library the window needs that the system lacks (libxkbcommon-x11 and the other X11
  ones, from the tar.gz and the AppImage) is named at start, on the terminal and in a message box,
  with the command that installs it, instead of a crash; in a Wayland session the window opens
  on Wayland instead ([#265](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/265))
- ✅ Linux: plain HTTP downloads work on a system without CA certificates, and HTTPS ones say to
  install them ([#264](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/264))
- ✅ Linux: torrents and magnet links work on a system without CA certificates too (peers, the
  DHT and `http://` trackers; `https://` trackers say why they can't), part of
  [#264](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/264)
- ✅ Update now finds the Linux and macOS release files whether or not their names end in
  "-experimental"
- ✅ The Linux release files are named without "-experimental" (`…-linux-x86_64.deb` and the
  others), in the packages' descriptions too; the macOS ones keep it
- ✅ Linux packages checked in clean Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12 and Fedora 45 systems: install, the
  command line, the window, the desktop entry and icon, browser integration and uninstall; the
  .deb and .rpm now bring the keyboard library MDM's window needs under X11 and the CA
  certificates downloads need, and require the glibc their programs were built for (part of
  [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ Options → Proxy's Get System and the Scheduler's "when done" drop-down fit in the last
  languages that still cut them (Bulgarian, Armenian, Macedonian, Tamil; Greek, Malayalam, and
  six the translation review lengthened), and the Proxy
  page's title no longer runs over its icon or past the window's edge in Greek, Finnish, Catalan
  and a few more: a title too long for one line beside Get System takes two
  ([#192](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/192))
- ✅ Linux: galleries work with the gallery-dl the distribution ships (Ubuntu 24.04's 1.26.9
  failed at once): MDM passes only the options that release accepts, from 1.20 on, and an older
  one gives way to MDM's own copy, saying why; the lab's test streams are real ones, which ffmpeg
  6.1 and 8 download to the end
  ([#236](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/236))
- ✅ Run MDM on a server without a window (Docker, Unraid, any Linux machine), and send it
  downloads from the phone or the browser extension
  ([#157](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/157))
- ✅ Better translations in every language: each language has a style guide and the terms its
  reviewers settled, and every machine translation of the program and the website was reviewed
  again against them
- ✅ Linux: browser integration reaches Brave Origin (and the Beta, Dev and Nightly versions of
  Brave, Chrome and Edge, and Vivaldi's snapshot); on macOS Brave is set up where it reads it,
  Chrome's folder. From the AppImage, the helper program the browsers start is copied out
  reliably, even while a browser still runs the old one, and put back at each start if it went
  missing; Test browser integration says when it is missing, or why setting it up failed
  ([#253](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/253))
- ✅ The extension's popup shows **Open Mister Download Manager** whole: it was cut to "Open Mister
  Do…" on Linux and in longer languages; Options moves below it when both don't fit on one line
  (part of [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ The crash report window's status line (such as "The symbols couldn't be fetched: …") stays
  inside the window: cut with "…" at its margin and shown whole under the pointer; its title is
  in MDM's language, and its title bar in MDM's light or dark (part of
  [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ Control MDM from a phone or another computer on the local network: **Options → Remote**, off
  by default; a paired device adds links, magnets and torrents, sees the list and pauses, starts
  and removes downloads ([#141](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/141))
- ✅ Linux: moving the pointer from an open submenu back onto its menu, or to another item, closes
  only the submenu, not the whole menu
  ([#250](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/250))
- ✅ Download File Info's Preview, Options → Proxy's Get System and the Scheduler's "when done"
  drop-down fit their translated text (Russian and others), after #212
  ([#192](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/192))
- ✅ A menu of the menu bar shut with Escape opens again at the first click on its title (on
  Linux it took two; on Windows, Escape with the pointer on the title left the menu open)
- ✅ A YouTube look-up that fails with "Requested format is not available" (signed in, no
  JavaScript runtime for yt-dlp) tries once more without the cookies; the video window says when
  ffmpeg would bring the better qualities a page offers
- ✅ Signed-in videos from YouTube Music and YouTube's mobile site: the browser's cookies reach
  the YouTube host yt-dlp asks, each for the domain the browser keeps it for
  ([#229](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/229))
- ✅ Cookies for video sites: yt-dlp can read a browser's cookies on this computer (Firefox,
  Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Chromium, Whale; Safari on macOS), so a pasted YouTube
  link that asks to "confirm you're not a bot" works when you're signed in there; and the button
  over videos now passes the page's cookies to the download as well as to the look-up
  ([#229](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/229))
- ✅ When the browser keeps a download, MDM says why: each one is in MDM's log with the setting
  that decided, and the extension's button shows the last one. The extension from the Chrome Web
  Store needs this release (0.2.x serves only the copy in MDM's folder)
  ([#208](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/208))
- ✅ Waterfox, and Firefox set to ask what to do with each file: MDM takes the download before
  the browser's *What should … do with this file?* dialog, which no longer shows for the files
  MDM takes ([#208](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/208))
- ✅ More file types taken from the browser by default: DMG, PKG, DEB, RPM, APPIMAGE, MSIX, APPX,
  CAB, JAR, XZ, ZST, WEBM, FLAC, OPUS and others; a list never edited gains them
  ([#208](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/208))
- ✅ Windows: Download File Info and the progress window open in front of the browser, even when
  Windows doesn't let MDM take the foreground; the keyboard stays where it was until a click
  ([#208](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/208))
- ✅ The window no longer freezes on Linux when the system's sleep service (logind) or keyring
  (Secret Service) is slow or doesn't answer: keeping the computer awake for a woken queue is
  asked in the background, a keyring that doesn't answer at start is waited for once instead of
  once per saved password, and the tray check and Download File Info's Save As check no longer
  wait on every frame (follows [#222](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/222))
- ✅ Linux: Dark Mode support follows the desktop's dark or light theme on XFCE, MATE and others
  without the portal's setting, and on GNOME without the portal, live
  ([#156](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/156))
- ✅ Started with the computer, MDM waits in the notification area instead of opening its window
  in front, on Windows, Linux and macOS (minimized where no notification area shows its icon);
  startup entries written before are updated, and the installer writes the new one
  ([#226](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/226))
- ✅ Open folder in Download complete no longer freezes the window on Linux when the file
  manager is slow to answer or never does: MDM asks in the background and opens the folder after
  5 seconds without an answer; every other program a window starts (Set it up, the Trash, an
  update being put in place, pages and folders) no longer holds the window either
  ([#222](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/222))
- ✅ A download too big for its drive is refused on a very busy computer too: the free-space
  check's 5 seconds count from when it runs, not from when it was asked, and it asks only the
  folder's own drive (shared network folders too) instead of listing every drive; and the host
  connection limit test tells a reconnect from a connection too many ([#224](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/224))
- ✅ The crash report window in every language: the report keeps its lines (German and Arabic
  ran them together) and reads left to right in Arabic and Persian; **End and restart MDM** fits
  its text ([#204](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/204))
- ✅ Every window's buttons fit their text in every language: Download File Info (German
  **Später herunterladen** was cut), Download complete, Add torrent, Download a gallery, the
  progress window, the Scheduler, Options, the Help menu's windows, RSS feeds, the video helpers
  and the browser window; English is unchanged, right to left too
  ([#192](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/192))
- ✅ Linux builds and window shots in minutes: a WSL2 machine builds any branch in about 5
  minutes (under one after a change) and shoots every window in any language in about a second
  each, never showing on the screen; the Linux desktops still check what needs them (part of
  [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ The Scheduler wakes the computer from sleep to run a queue, and keeps it awake while the
  queue runs: on Windows when the power plan allows wake timers (the Scheduler says when it
  doesn't), on Linux once an administrator allows it, and on macOS it says why it can't
  ([#142](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/142))
- ✅ A finished download no longer fails with "part file still in use" on a busy computer, and
  the rest of the engine tests that failed now and then there (slow connections, a prompt stop,
  speed limits, links that expire, sparse files and a few more) wait for what they check, not for
  time; the slow-connection test now fails if the engine stops reconnecting slow connections,
  which it didn't before ([#201](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/201))
- ✅ A window closed with its title bar's × keeps its contents until it goes, instead of turning
  black for a moment (seconds on Linux) ([#207](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/207))
- ✅ A freeze while MDM handles a command, or minimized, opens the crash report window and writes
  its freeze report again ([#202](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/202))
- ✅ Where a download's server is: its country's flag and name and its round trip (near, medium or
  far) in Download File Info, the progress window and Properties, from a table that comes with MDM
  (no address is sent anywhere); a proxy or a CDN said as such
  ([#140](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/140))
- ✅ Torrents: Download in order, to watch a video while it downloads (each file's first and last
  pieces first, its own choice); other torrents now take the rarest pieces first
  ([#39](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/39))
- ✅ Every mark in the windows is drawn in every language (the browser window's ✔ Connected
  was an empty box, → on Linux), and the browser and video-helper windows put their logo at the
  start side in Arabic and Persian and fit a long German headline and subline
  ([#185](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/185),
  [#170](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/170))
- ✅ A Linux test machine for every change, scripted: an Ubuntu 24.04 desktop that builds each
  branch and drives MDM, Firefox and Chrome there (part of
  [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ The Linux test machine also has KDE Plasma, Cinnamon and XFCE copies, which test a build
  without making it; store packages and theme windows are checked there too (part of
  [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ Firefox: reading the browser's proxy (#42) is an opt-in, a switch in the extension's popup, so
  the extension's update asks for no new permission; a VPN add-on's proxy goes with the downloads
  taken before Firefox's file dialog too, and addresses on this computer skip the proxy, as in
  Firefox
- ✅ Chrome and the other Chromium browsers: downloads go through the browser's proxy or VPN
  extension too (#42), with the same switch, off as installed: a fixed server for each scheme and
  its bypass list, or an auto-config script
- ✅ Streams whose address doesn't end in .m3u8 or .mpd, served as plain text, are found too: by
  the button over the video, the right-click menu and the media list, read only when asked
  ([#171](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/171))
- ✅ The extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mister-download-manager/ejoleppdfgjdndddcjoehopknmlglojp): **Add to Chrome** beside **Add to Firefox**
  on the website, in the help, the FAQ and the README; MDM's **Add Mister Download Manager to
  your browser** window opens the store in Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera and Vivaldi, with the
  manual install as the fallback
- ✅ Themes, the groundwork: every colour and size the controls are drawn with comes from one
  theme, and theme files can change them; the classic look is unchanged
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ View → Theme: Classic (the default), Native (the system's accent colour and high contrast,
  followed as they change) and High contrast
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Themes: Metro, Windows 8's flat look (its controls, a drawn title bar on Windows, Fluent
  icons); themes choose each control's style and bring their own icons
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Themes: Adwaita, GNOME's look (its controls, a header bar on Windows, GNOME's Adwaita icons
  in colour and one colour)
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Themes: Breeze, KDE Plasma's look (its focus frame, check boxes, buttons and title bar on
  Windows, KDE's Breeze icons)
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Themes: Luna, Aero and Aqua, the looks of Windows XP, Windows 7 and Mac OS X (shaded and
  glossy buttons, their check boxes and progress bars, their title bars on Windows, icons drawn
  for MDM); Metro, Adwaita and Breeze get MDM's own icons where theirs had none
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Themes: Base16 and pywal colour schemes imported as themes (View → Theme → Add a theme
  file…, or the themes folder); **pywal** follows `wal` as it writes new colours, text kept
  readable (4.5:1) ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Themes: Emerald (a white canvas, one near-black ink, emerald
  fills carrying near-black text, 6-point corners, Metro's one-colour icons); its theme file
  gives a few seeds per variant and derives every other colour, so a role added later arrives
  in this look rather than the classic one
  ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ Dark mode: grey notes and error texts readable (4.5:1), Options' failed checks no longer dark
  red on the dark dialog ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45))
- ✅ A minimized MDM keeps working: queues, the Scheduler, download limits, the kill switch and
  saving the list no longer wait for the window to be restored
- ✅ Download video: every button fits its text in every language (German **ffmpeg installieren**
  was cut), right to left too ([#172](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/172))
- ✅ The engine tests that failed now and then on a busy computer (a refused connection coming
  back, the learned connection limit, a dead address) wait for what they check, not for time
  ([#136](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/136))
- ✅ HLS and DASH videos from the browser reach yt-dlp as their stream, by the button over the
  video, the right-click menu (it did nothing in Firefox) and the media list
  ([#155](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/155))
- ✅ A download or magnet link sent while the window is minimized opens its window at once
  ([#162](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/162))
- ✅ Linux: Ubuntu's Firefox (the Snap) reaches MDM: browser integration is set up for it, and the
  help says what the desktop asks the first time; Chromium as a Snap, which can't reach MDM, is no
  longer offered (part of [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ A smaller download: the installer 15 % and the zips 19 % smaller, nothing removed
  ([#158](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/158))
- ✅ Linux: MDM's first window opens seconds sooner; the system's fonts are looked up all at once
  while it starts, not one by one in the window (on a busy computer that froze it, part of
  [#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164))
- ✅ Firefox's add-on offered from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/mister-download-manager/)
  first: **Add to Firefox** on the website, in the help, the FAQ and the README, and in MDM's
  **Add Mister Download Manager to your browser** window (for Zen and LibreWolf too)
- ✅ Support MDM: a way to support its creator on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/anefzaoui),
  asked for only (**Help → Support MDM**, a line in About, the website, the README, the
  extension's popup and GitHub's Sponsor button); MDM stays free, nothing changes or unlocks
- ✅ A server that can't resume a download no longer gets the file downloaded twice on a busy
  computer (part of [#136](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/136))
- ✅ Translators: a reviewed translation is never replaced by machine translation, and CI checks it;
  Italian is the first catalog reviewed by a native speaker
  ([#150](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/150))
- ✅ Screen readers reach every row of a list, in view or not (300 around the view in long lists)
  ([#111](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/111))
- ✅ Less memory in the notification area after Minimize too, and again 2 minutes after hiding
  ([#72](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/72))
- ✅ Windows: MDM draws with Direct3D 12 by default; **View → Draw with** goes back to OpenGL, and
  either one falls back to the other when it can't start
  ([#89](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/89))
- ✅ A slow start no longer turns Direct3D off for good: its 10 seconds for the first frame count
  only Direct3D's own time, not MDM's loading (on one computer that sent MDM to OpenGL, where
  Intel's driver froze it); crash and freeze reports say near the top what drew, on which card
  and driver, and why
  ([#280](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/280))
- ✅ Linux and macOS: **View → Draw with → Vulkan** (Linux) and **Metal** (macOS), with the same
  fallback to OpenGL as Direct3D on Windows; OpenGL stays their default for now, and the menu
  says why when one can't start here
  ([#206](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/206))
- ✅ Screen readers see a window's contents the first time they read it, not only its title bar
  ([#131](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/131))
- ✅ Magnet links get their file list in seconds again: the DHT keeps going after a computer it
  asked is gone, and Add torrent shows the wait (peers found, from where, what may be in the
  way) ([#92](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/92))
- ✅ Two engine tests that failed now and then on busy machines are reliable
  ([#123](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/123))
- ✅ Numbers are grouped and pointed the interface language's way (German `10.200`, `1,50 MB`)
  ([#128](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/128))
- ✅ The extension's button lists the media the tab has loaded (HLS and DASH streams, video and
  sound files), to download a stream the page won't give up; copy-protected ones are shown as
  protected, never downloaded ([#38](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/38))
- ✅ Torrents: RSS feeds with download rules (words, episodes, each episode once, a folder per rule)
  ([#39](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/39))
- ✅ Torrents: Recheck, Reannounce, Add trackers and Copy magnet link; choose files while a
  torrent runs, or in Torrent → Files… for any torrent (stopped or complete too); a check of the
  files says "Checking 42%"; a finished torrent that isn't shared lets go of its files; a
  `.torrent` file's web address opens Add torrent ([#39](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/39))
- ✅ Link grabber: links in packages, looked up for name and size; archives (zip and tar
  built in; 7z and RAR need 7-Zip) extracted when they are downloaded
  ([#37](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/37)); collecting copied links
  comes later
- ✅ Image galleries with gallery-dl: Wikimedia Commons, Flickr, DeviantArt and many more,
  verified like yt-dlp, or your own copy ([#58](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/58))
- ✅ Torrents: seeding limits (a share ratio, or a time), off by default, and a finished torrent's
  tabs while it is shared ([#39](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/39))
- ✅ A paused or finished download no longer leaves its progress file to be written again a moment
  later ([#106](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/106)), and a download
  finishing during a save no longer fails ([#116](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/116))
- ✅ Tests and test tools stay on 127.0.0.1: no Windows Firewall questions while developing
- ✅ Debrid accounts (experimental): Real-Debrid, AllDebrid and Premiumize; file-host links downloaded through your own account (Options → Accounts)
  ([#44](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/44))
- ✅ Debrid accounts: a per-download "directly instead" choice, "through the service" in Download
  File Info, and the command line using the accounts
  ([#44](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/44))
- ✅ Debrid accounts: torrents and magnet links through the service, their files downloaded over
  HTTP, no peer connections ([#44](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/44))
- ✅ Debrid accounts (experimental): TorBox, for file-host links and torrents
  ([#391](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/391))
- ✅ Sign-ins in the system's keychain: Windows Credential Manager, the Secret Service keyring on
  Linux, the macOS keychain; for debrid accounts, Sites Logins and the proxy
  ([#44](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/44))
- ✅ Downloads through one network adapter (a VPN's), with a kill switch: nothing goes out
  another way when it disconnects ([#35](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/35))
- ✅ Torrents on Windows through the chosen network adapter, with the same kill switch
  ([#143](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/143))
- ✅ Video pages and image galleries through the chosen network adapter too, with the same kill
  switch ([#35](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/35))
- ✅ Downloads from a browser behind a VPN or proxy extension go through the same proxy
  ([#42](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/42))
- ✅ Hide to the notification area: a download's progress window (its own button, or Minimize)
  and the main window's Minimize, with the tray's "Downloads in progress"
  ([#63](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/63))
- ✅ Whole playlists and channels, one quality for all: also as the original sound, MP3, Opus or FLAC
  ([#69](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/69))
- ✅ Choose the DNS: Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, AdGuard, NextDNS or your own, over HTTPS, TLS or
  plain, with a Test button and no silent fallback
  ([#36](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/36))
- ✅ Less memory in the notification area: under 10 MB there, and the language list's fonts let
  go when it closes ([#72](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/72))
- ✅ Video downloads: subtitles, beside the video or inside it
  ([#68](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/68)); more audio choices:
  the original track, Opus and FLAC ([#70](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/70))
- ✅ Torrent security: stricter file-name checks, no silent overwrite, files marked as downloaded
  from the internet, network switches (incoming, UPnP, port, DHT, local peers), SOCKS5 proxy and
  IP blocklist ([#40](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/40))
- ✅ Torrents: a speed limit per torrent, remembered limits, and the global cap covering torrents
  too ([#39](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/39))
- ✅ Torrents: upload limits (all torrents, and each one), and a share ratio that survives pauses
  and restarts ([#39](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/39))
- ✅ Google Drive: public files download by their share links
  ([#34](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/34)); folders come later
- ✅ Video downloads: Stop ends yt-dlp and everything it started
  ([#61](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/61)); no error while yt-dlp
  goes on and finishes ([#79](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/79)); a
  quality the reachable YouTube servers don't serve falls back to the nearest one
  ([#94](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/94))
- ✅ A video's sound as MP3, at the quality you pick
  ([#32](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/32))
- ✅ More than 32 connections per download, if you want them
  ([#12](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/12))
- ✅ Your own yt-dlp and ffmpeg ([#51](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/51))
- ✅ View → Always dark ([#60](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/60))
- ✅ Zen, Helium and other Firefox- and Chromium-based browsers
  ([#41](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/41))
- ✅ Linux: menus open where clicked under Wayland
  ([#50](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/50)), and the window closes on
  desktops without a tray, such as MangoWC ([#59](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/59))
- ✅ Downloads that hand out one-time links no longer fail with 403
  ([#28](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/28))
- ✅ The extension's Download video menu keeps its highlight inside its edge
  ([#81](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/81))
- ✅ No crash when a window opens while MDM is minimized or in the notification area, such as a
  download or a magnet link from the browser
  ([#22](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/22),
  [#145](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/145))
- ✅ Long file names stay inside the progress window: the Save to path is shortened in the
  middle, in every language ([#62](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/62))
- ✅ Every button translated: Download complete's Open with... no longer stays in English
  ([#80](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/80))
- ✅ A smaller download ([#25](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/25)),
  AppImage updates with zsync ([#24](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/24)),
  the Bangladesh flag for Bangla ([#27](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/27))
- ✅ Download complete shows above other windows, Options from the extension comes to the front
  ([#77](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/77)), and dragging the file out
  of Download complete works in every language
  ([#78](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/78))
- ✅ The built-in categories can be renamed, given other file types and deleted, and restored
  ([#93](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/93))
- ✅ A file-type icon before every file name, in every window that names a file (the download
  list, Download File Info, Properties, Download complete, Add torrent, a torrent's files, the
  Scheduler, Batch download, Download video and its playlists), each the system's own icon for
  its type (Windows Explorer's, macOS Finder's, the Linux desktop's icon theme), sharp at every
  display scale
  ([#122](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/122)), and every
  list's rows named for screen readers ([#95](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/95)),
  inside their list, with their place in it ([#102](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/102));
  the Categories pane, the menu bar and every right-click menu too, with Shift+F10 and the Menu key
  ([#113](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/113))
- ✅ The README's, the docs' and the website's screenshots are taken on a stock Windows (GitHub's
  runner), so the file icons in them are Windows' own
- ✅ The help shows what it describes: pictures of each window, numbered where a step points at
  one control, step strips for the usual flows, in light and dark, made from one shot list
  ([#228](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/228))
- ✅ Website in European Portuguese, and an [intended use](https://misterdownloadmanager.com/intended-use.html) page
- ✅ Website: the [free IDM alternative](https://misterdownloadmanager.com/idm-alternative.html) page compares
  MDM with IDM and with nine other free download managers, each checked on its own site, with
  their logos, a feature-by-feature form and an MDM-vs-IDM label with the benchmark's times to scale
- ✅ Website: the header fits its row in every language at every width (it hides the Sponsor heart,
  then tightens, then turns into the menu, only as far as a language needs)
  ([#168](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/168)), and no page scrolls
  sideways on a phone, Arabic and Persian included: long paths, links and tables wrap or scroll
  inside the page ([#169](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/169))
- ✅ Help opens the website's help pages, in the interface language when the website has it
  ([#227](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/227))
- ✅ Website: a page for every feature, old and new, with its real window, where it is in the app
  and what it can't do yet; tiles of them all on the home page; and a
  [Themes](https://misterdownloadmanager.com/themes.html) page with every built-in theme, light and
  dark, and how to make, try and share your own
  ([#260](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/260))
- ✅ Thanks to the people who make MDM possible: everyone who sent a pull request, opened an issue
  or commented on GitHub, as round photos in the home page's first view and the README, on a
  [Contributors](https://misterdownloadmanager.com/contributors.html) page with what each one did,
  at the end of each release on the News page, and in each release's notes on GitHub
- ✅ Themes ([#45](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/45)): today's look stays the default. Every colour, size and spacing now
  comes from the chosen theme (the classic look pixel for pixel the same); **View → Theme** with
  Classic, Native (follows the system's accent and contrast on Windows, Linux and macOS) and High
  contrast; style themes with their own control shapes, a drawn title bar on Windows and their own
  icons: Metro, Adwaita, Breeze, Luna, Aero and Aqua; and theme files anyone can make, try and
  share, in TOML or JSON, built on any theme (`inherits`), with their own icons; Base16 and
  pywal colour schemes read as themes ([the guide](docs/themes.md))
- ✅ Linux, no longer experimental: every change is checked on Ubuntu (GNOME) as well as Windows,
  and on KDE Plasma, Cinnamon and Xfce; Wayland sessions (through XWayland, menus under their
  titles on sway too); the .deb and .rpm installed in clean Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora systems, the
  AppImage and the tar.gz; the tray, Dark Mode support and Launch on startup on all four desktops;
  the Snap Firefox, Google Chrome and Brave reaching MDM
  ([#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164)), and its release files
  named without "-experimental"
- ✅ Every screenshot taken again on Windows and Linux (smaller files, WebP), and every page of the
  docs, the README and the website brought up to date
  ([#186](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/186))

## Version 0.5.2

Bug fixes from the first days of 0.5.0, a Safari extension, and more file types.

- ✅ A link from the browser no longer ends in 403 where a site refuses the browser's
  User-Agent: MDM asks once more as itself ([#372](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/372))
- ✅ The video button no longer covers a control of the page (a preview's own button): it takes
  a free corner, and dragging it keeps it where you put it
  ([#421](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/421))
- ✅ A background task stopping as MDM closes no longer shows a crash report
  ([#422](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/422))
- ✅ A freeze that was over before its dump was taken is reported as a freeze, not a crash in the
  watchdog (part of [#420](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/420))
- ✅ File names and titles in any script show their letters: the system font for a script
  outside the interface language loads the first time it is needed, instead of boxes
  ([#405](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/405))
- ✅ yt-dlp and gallery-dl use the proxy set in Options → Proxy / Socks
  ([#363](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/363))
- ✅ The window keeps answering while reading the clipboard or removing a cancelled download's
  files from a slow disk ([#418](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/418),
  [#423](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/423))
- ✅ Fast downloads keep going on a slow disk: flushing the resume state no longer holds up
  the connections, and a connection is never replaced for the disk's wait
  ([#361](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/361))
- ✅ Freeze reports taken after the window has already answered say so, instead of blaming a deadlock
  (part of [#355](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/355))
- ✅ **Move/Rename** works on several selected downloads at once: pick a folder and they all go there
  ([#333](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/333))
- ✅ Download video shows the size of a plain file (what the server says), not "size unknown"
  (part of [#320](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/320))
- ✅ Download video on pages whose player first loads a manifest's address answering something else
  (SVT Play): the real manifest goes to MDM, not that first answer
  ([#377](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/377))
- ✅ Windows: sharp, evenly spaced text at every interface size: letters no longer run together
  or drift apart ([#323](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/323),
  [#334](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/334))
- ✅ Far more file types taken by default: AI models and datasets, 3D and CAD, design and camera
  RAW, ebooks, Office, disk images and split archives; a list never edited gains them
  ([#382](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/382))
- ✅ A save folder relative to the home folder is found where it really is
- ✅ Browser link import: tighter handling of site data
- ✅ The extension asks for a newer MDM only when a whole release separates them, not over a
  bug-fix version
- ✅ Add URL: a YouTube playlist opens the video window; Dailymotion's embedded player is looked
  up as the video's own page ([#338](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/338),
  [#359](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/359))
- ✅ macOS: video look-ups work in a copy of MDM a browser downloaded, without the Terminal command:
  yt-dlp's folder build, unpacked once and checked against its signed list
  ([#330](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/330),
  [#339](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/339))
- ✅ In English, the list's dates follow the system's 12- or 24-hour clock
  ([#392](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/392))
- ✅ Help: what to do when an antivirus or VirusTotal flags MDM, and how to check a copy is the real
  one
- ✅ The Safari extension (macOS), part of the app: a click on a link to a listed file type, the
  right-click items, the button over videos, Media on this page and the toolbar button, from one
  source with the other browsers' extension. Safari gives extensions no way to see its downloads, so
  a download a page starts by itself stays with Safari
- ✅ A torrent's peers and share ratio as columns in the download list
  ([#357](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/357))
- ✅ The browser extension's media list can name a file after its page, as an option (off as
  installed)
- ✅ Malay: the menus, toolbar and list columns checked by a native speaker
- ✅ Closing the main window follows a setting (on by default, MDM keeps running), and with no tray
  icon the window goes to the taskbar instead of vanishing
  ([#457](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/457))
- ✅ Download File Info no longer stays open but invisible, with later browser downloads waiting
  behind it ([#440](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/440))
- ✅ Arabic and other non-Latin file names arrive readable from Firefox and browsers built on it
  ([#447](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/447))
- ✅ A file renamed to avoid a clash shows and opens under its new name
  ([#442](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/442))
- ✅ RSS feeds: the rule boxes keep the keyboard while you type
  ([#353](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/353))
- ✅ Video progress no longer reads 100 % while still downloading, and a video known only by its
  address is named after its page, not a long encoded string
  ([#344](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/344),
  [#345](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/345))
- ✅ A page that starts a download by script: MDM gets the file, not the page
  ([#374](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/374))
- ✅ "Hide tab" in a download's window takes the tab off its row; **Show hidden tabs** brings it back
  ([#326](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/326))
- ✅ A download stopped in a running queue stays stopped
  ([#341](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/341))
- ✅ No crash when removing the last feed in the RSS feeds window
  ([#321](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/321))
- ✅ **Open folder** works on a torrent still downloading
  ([#354](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/354))
- ✅ Alt and F10 open the menu bar while a control has the focus
  ([#328](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/328))
- ✅ Windows: no crash when a window opens while MDM falls back from Direct3D to OpenGL
  ([#337](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/337))
- ✅ Windows: no crash when a screen goes away while MDM runs
  ([#335](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/335))
- ✅ No duplicate prompt for a finished file that is gone
  ([#342](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/342))
- ✅ Crash reports: a monitor that cannot open its socket exits, and an unreachable one is cleaned up
  instead of staying beside MDM
  ([#458](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/458))

## Version 0.5.1

- ✅ The Download video button on YouTube: the video playing now instead of the one before or a
  whole list, Shorts included
  ([#311](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/311))
- ✅ The Download video button on YouTube in Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera and Vivaldi

## Done since 0.5.2

These ship in the next version.

- ✅ Windows: a graphics card whose OpenGL is older than 3.0 and that has no Direct3D 12 (Intel's
  first HD Graphics) no longer draws MDM's windows as garbage: MDM notices that OpenGL, draws
  with Direct3D on Windows' own software renderer (WARP) instead, from then on, and **View → Draw
  with** says why; the reporter confirmed WARP draws it right
  ([#835](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/835))
- ✅ A helper (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, gallery-dl) that can't be downloaded says which server and why
  (not found, refused, no answer, a secure connection an antivirus or a proxy reads, GitHub's
  limit on requests, cut short) and what to do; its release list goes through the proxy set in
  Options, as its download did ([#816](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/816))
- ✅ Link grabber lists a web page's links when given the page's address (pasted, copied, in
  a list), as the browser's "Download all links" does, instead of only the page itself
  ([#705](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/705))
- ✅ Windows: **Open with...** shows Windows' "Select an app to open this file" again, for
  files whose name or folder has a space too
  ([#720](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/720))
- ✅ A file host's web page (a countdown, a captcha, DropMeFiles', dailyuploads') is never saved
  under the archive's name and called finished: the download stops, says the site sent its page
  and to finish in the browser, and the progress window's **Open in browser** opens the link
  there. The page is told by its first bytes too, when it comes as the file's own type or under
  its name, by the size the browser announced, and on resume, which keeps the data already
  downloaded ([#701](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/701),
  [#692](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/692))
- ✅ **Embed chapters**: a video's chapters go into the downloaded file (with ffmpeg), on by
  default, in the Download video window under Subtitles
  ([#827](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/827))
- ✅ A YouTube video that lists only the sound says why: yt-dlp has no JavaScript runtime. The
  video window, the menu over a video and the command line say to install Node.js or Deno, with
  a link to the help page's commands for each system
  ([#852](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/852))
- ✅ Linux: no freeze of the window where the session bus doesn't answer (a session started
  without D-Bus, a bus that hangs): the tray icon is set up beside the window, which carries on
  without it until the bus answers, and gets it then, however late
  ([#828](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/828))
- ✅ Looking up a new video (put online in the last two days) no longer fails with "Permission
  denied" in MDM's install folder: the helpers run in your temporary folder, or MDM's own if
  that one can't be written ([#834](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/834))
- ✅ A video a site sends through a program's address (`stream.php?file=…`,
  `remote_control.php`) is named by what it is: the page's title (or the address's `file=` name)
  and its real type, `Lecture.mp4`, not `stream.php`; the browser's media list shows that name
  and type, and the Download video window saves it instead of failing on its `.php`
  ([#695](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/695),
  [#800](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/800))
- ✅ The issue tracker: an issue waiting for details from its reporter is labelled "needs info";
  with no answer 14 days after our question it closes with a note, and the reporter's reply
  opens it again
- ✅ Ideas move to GitHub Discussions (Ideas), where they can be talked over and voted on; the
  issue form for them points there
- ✅ **Add batch download from clipboard** reads every link copied (a list, a forum post): http,
  ftp and magnet links, each once, ticked in Link grabber, started or queued together with one
  summary at the end; a copied address with a number in it (`…/ep01.mp4`) opens Batch download
  with its pattern; also in the tray menu, and Ctrl+B. Copying several links no longer opens
  Download File Info with them run together
  ([#709](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/709),
  [#780](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/780))
- ✅ Windows: downloads follow the Group Policy "Do not preserve zone information in file
  attachments", as browsers' do; **Options → Save to → Mark downloaded files as coming from
  the internet** (on by default) turns the mark off for MDM alone, on every system
  ([#813](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/813))
- ✅ No freeze of the window on **Tasks → Import** of a large file, or of one that isn't a list
  (a video, an archive, another program's backup): it is read beside the window, the status strip
  says "Reading …", a file over 64 MB is refused with a message, and Link grabber takes 10,000
  links at once ([#805](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/805))
- ✅ A video quality's size is the size of what downloads: each line of the Download video window
  and of the browser's menu is the very video and sound it was sized from, and a size that is
  only an estimate shows as about ("~532 MB"); a portrait 4K video showed 3.79 GB and downloaded
  532 MB ([#801](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/801))
- ✅ Video qualities show their codec, frame rate and HDR (`2160p · VP9 · 60 fps · HDR`), and AV1,
  VP9 and H.264, HDR and SDR of one resolution are each their own choice; the best stays first
  ([#755](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/755))
- ✅ Fewer Download complete windows: downloads added together (a playlist, a batch, Link
  grabber's links) show one summary once all are done, with how many finished and which failed,
  Open folder and Show in list; a single download keeps its window
  ([#766](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/766)). **Snooze** in Download complete keeps it away for
  30 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours or until MDM restarts, and Options → Downloads says until when, with
  Resume now ([#741](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/741))
- ✅ WinGet in the install steps: the README, the help and the website's download page give
  `winget install AhmedNefzaoui.MisterDownloadManager` and `winget upgrade`
  ([#798](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/798))
- ✅ The Download video button, redesigned ([#703](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/703)): MDM looks the video up as the
  button appears and the button names the best quality, which one click downloads; a plain file
  downloads as a file; its menu lists every quality; after a click it says what happened in its
  own colour, with Show, Open post, Get MDM and Retry, or Turn on
- ✅ The video button no longer comes back on play or pause, and fades sooner (part of
  [#741](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/741))
- ✅ No freeze of the window while it checks Windows' light or dark mode and the registry takes
  seconds to answer: the system's look and the theme files are read beside the window
  ([#719](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/719))
- ✅ Windows 10: no black band above the progress window's title bar, and clicks land on its
  buttons again ([#620](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/620),
  [#772](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/772)): the progress window and
  the style themes' dialogs are framed as on Windows 11, without a hidden title bar
- ✅ Fast downloads to a hard disk keep going past the first gigabytes: no more freezes of 7 to
  10 s once the system's cache is full, and no connection replaced as "much slower" for waiting on
  the disk; a disk slower than the network slows the download down evenly
  ([#782](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/782))
- ✅ Windows: MDM starts on a PC without Microsoft's Visual C++ runtime, or with the wrong copy of it
  (0xc000007b at setup's end): the runtime is inside MDM's programs
  ([#785](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/785))
- ✅ Videos in one file (YouTube's qualities and their sound, most sites' MP4s) come down through
  MDM's own downloader: yt-dlp finds them, then every connection Options → Connection gives, the
  speed limits (a change applies at once), pause and resume like a file, after a restart too,
  and a fresh address from yt-dlp when one expires (part of
  [#769](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/769))
- ✅ Videos sent in pieces (HLS, DASH) through MDM's own downloader too, several pieces at once
  (as many as a file's connections), AES-128 pieces decrypted, expired pieces' addresses asked of
  yt-dlp again ([#531](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/531), part of
  [#769](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/769))
- ✅ Image galleries through MDM's own downloader: gallery-dl lists the pictures, MDM brings
  them in 4 at a time under the speed limits, gallery-dl fetches only what is left
  ([#769](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/769))
- ✅ Sites behind Akamai's bot check (a 403 page for MDM, the file for a browser) download, through the
  browser-like connection ([#771](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/771))
- ✅ Crash and freeze reports no longer have their log's end filled with warnings about the
  file-type icons ([#767](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/767))
- ✅ Videos and image galleries keep to the speed limits (for one file, their own, and all
  downloads together), and start again with a new one when it changes; one started while the
  Scheduler's download limit is reached waits
  ([#708](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/708))
- ✅ The browser's Download video button in right-to-left languages: its corners and divider follow the text direction, so its outline stays whole
- ✅ A freeze of the download windows on a drive slow to answer (a sleeping disk, a USB drive, a
  network folder): Download File Info's numbered name, Show in folder, Download complete and
  creating a missing folder ask the disk beside the window
  ([#743](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/743),
  [#751](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/751))
- ✅ **Deferred Rename** on a download's **Download status** tab: save a new name while downloading to rename the finished file's stem (and video subtitles) or an exclusive finished folder on completion, leaving shared/save or pre-existing folders, split-archive volumes and single-file torrents under their original names ([#655](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/655))
- ✅ Links added by hand go with the User-Agent of your default browser, at the version you have
  (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Firefox, Safari), instead of a years-old one; **Automatic**
  in Options, or one you type (part of
  [#668](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/668))
- ✅ Linux freeze and crash reports name MDM's functions again, and the right ones: the stack of
  a program whose code begins a page after its start (0.5.0's) was read at the wrong place, so
  reports showed only system libraries, or names from elsewhere in MDM
  ([#661](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/661))
- ✅ Windows: a freeze in the C runtime's memory routines, where the window hardly ran, is
  reported as a computer too busy or slow to load MDM from disk, not as a deadlock
  ([#663](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/663))
- ✅ macOS: helpers opened from Finder find Homebrew's Deno and ffmpeg, so YouTube formats
  load ([#659](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/659))
- ✅ The website is named as the official one in the README, the browser add-on and the
  site's data for search engines
- ✅ Left click on the tray icon toggles the main window (on Windows also with the icon under
  the taskbar's ^), and browser downloads open only their dialog when the main window is
  hidden or minimized ([#520](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/520))
- ✅ Debrid accounts: signing in by code opens only the service's own page
- ✅ A speed limit raised or turned off applies at once, to the connections already waiting
  under the old one too ([#621](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/621))
- ✅ The build and release workflows: each job gets only the permissions it needs, and every
  action and release tool is pinned to an exact version
- ✅ A freeze on a slow disk, the data folder looked up on every tick
  ([#565](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/565))
- ✅ A `funding.json` file, the open format funds use to find projects and what they need
- ✅ The tools that send the browser extension to the stores, at their current versions
- ✅ macOS: downloads to a network volume (SMB, AFP, NFS), refused for "0 bytes free"
  ([#623](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/623))
- ✅ Helium: MDM offers it the extension on Linux and macOS, through Helium's own services, the Linux
  packages' helper files cover it, and the docs say how to add the extension in Helium
  ([#685](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/685))
- ✅ Torrents: the window no longer freezes while torrents run on a busy or slow disk: their numbers
  are read beside the window instead of waiting on the torrent engine
  ([#693](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/693))
- ✅ Sites that let only browsers through (Cloudflare's bot check, FileHippo's 412): MDM tries once
  more connecting the way a browser does, with the cookies it has for that site (part of
  [#668](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/668))
- ✅ Downloads from FileHippo no longer fail at once with 412 Precondition Failed: a link the site
  refuses goes on from where the browser's own download of it had reached, then through the
  browser-like connection above
  ([#630](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/630))
- ✅ Download video: a sound-only choice (MP3, a playlist as sound) saves in the Music folder and is
  listed under Music ([#611](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/611))
- ✅ Linux and macOS: the system's gallery-dl is used when MDM has none of its own, as yt-dlp is
  ([#571](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/571))
- ✅ Linux and macOS: the system's yt-dlp is used when MDM has none of its own, and Helpers can
  switch to MDM's copy ([#452](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/452))
- ✅ The Download video button lists the video's qualities, with their sizes, in a menu on the page,
  video and audio in their own tabs: the one picked downloads at once with only its progress window,
  MDM's main window staying where it is; "Open in Mister Download Manager…" keeps the Download video
  window. A stream the page plays (HLS) is listed at once, the same video asked again within 10
  minutes opens at once, and the pick starts without looking the video up a second time
  ([#449](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/449))
- ✅ Picking a video quality already in the list (the menu over a video, the Download video window)
  follows Options' duplicate setting instead of downloading it again
  ([#449](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/449))
- ✅ The progress window's bar glides instead of moving in steps
  ([#449](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/449))
- ✅ A stream's qualities (HLS) show a size in the Download video window, estimated from their
  bitrate and the video's length
  ([#449](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/pull/449))
- ✅ Torrents: an **Upload speed** column in the download list, beside **Transfer rate** (part of
  [#357](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/357))
- ✅ Cancel in Download File Info asks whether the downloads waiting behind it are cancelled too (a
  browser selection's arrive one by one)
  ([#394](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/394))
- ✅ The browser's video button over a video in a feed sends the post the video sits in (LinkedIn,
  Facebook, X, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, Vimeo, Dailymotion, and a post's own link on other sites),
  else the video's own file, else it says to open the post, instead of the feed's address where
  yt-dlp found nothing ([#689](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/689));
  checked on a signed-in LinkedIn feed and Facebook's video pages, Facebook's feed posts still to
  check ([#643](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/643))
- ✅ Torrents: a pause landing while a piece is being checked no longer leaves the torrent one piece
  short until MDM restarts: the piece is downloaded again
  ([#706](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/706))
- ✅ Windows: the tray icon's menu follows MDM's look, dark or light, on Windows 10 and 11
  ([#682](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/682))
- ✅ Torrents: magnet links without trackers find peers where the DHT's first nodes don't answer:
  four public routers asked together, the IPv6 nodes kept for the next start, and the port picked
  kept from one start to the next
  ([#650](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/650))
- ✅ Windows: the window no longer stops on a stalled system (a disk held for a restore point or a
  backup, for one) to check its title bars' colours: they are set once, when a window opens or the
  theme changes; MDM's log and the RSS feeds are written beside the window too
  ([#633](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/633),
  [#583](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/583),
  [#513](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/513))
- ✅ Windows: no crash when the clipboard is read in two places at once (the clipboard monitor and
  Add URL): every read and write of it goes one at a time
  ([#629](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/629))
- ✅ The window no longer waits on the program that owns the clipboard when it doesn't answer (Linux
  especially): a text box's right-click menu, Add URL, Add batch download, Add torrent and Download
  video read the clipboard beside the window, and fill in a copied link when it comes (follows
  [#418](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/418))
- ✅ Categories without their own folder follow General's folder (`Video`, `Music`, `Torrents` inside
  it), and Add torrent starts with the Torrents category's folder instead of flipping from General
  when the metadata arrives ([#556](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/556),
  [#550](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/550))
- ✅ Windows: dragging a file out of Download complete no longer holds up the window for as long as
  the program under the pointer takes: the drag runs beside the window
  ([#561](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/561))
- ✅ The video button keeps one corner over YouTube's thumbnail previews, within the pointer's reach
  ([#560](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/560))
- ✅ Menus: moving on from an item with a submenu closes the submenu at once, and only the item under
  the pointer is lit ([#579](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/579))
- ✅ Chromium browsers: a download MDM's extension leaves to the browser keeps the file name and
  folder another extension gives it (Save In's)
  ([#578](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/578))
- ✅ Without ffmpeg, YouTube's sound alone comes from a format sent as one file, and HLS pieces are
  saved as what they are, not as an `.mp4` no player opened
  ([#569](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/569))
- ✅ A progress window with a title of 256 characters or more gets MDM's own title bar, not the
  system's above it, so its buttons answer (part of
  [#540](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/540), with the Windows 10 fix
  above)
- ✅ macOS 15 and later: Chinese text finds PingFang again, which moved into the system's font assets
  ([#541](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/541))
- ✅ The video button goes when it is switched off, or its site listed, in Options, in pages already
  open ([#532](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/532))
- ✅ macOS: Persian and other Arabic-script file names show their letters in the download list, not
  boxes ([#533](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/533))
- ✅ A server's refusal page is no longer saved under the document's name and shown as complete,
  where the browser had the file: a web page where a file was expected stops with an error (part of
  [#533](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/533))
- ✅ macOS: Download File Info opens in front of the browser that asked for it
  ([#484](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/484))
- ✅ macOS: MDM's icon shows in the menu bar, so closing the window keeps MDM running there instead
  of quitting ([#529](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/529))
- ✅ The video button fades after a click on the player, in fullscreen too, and stays while you use
  the keyboard; its browser test runs before the one that turns the button off
  ([#480](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/480))
- ✅ The video button stays over a hover-to-play preview (YouTube's thumbnails) long enough to be
  clicked ([#503](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/503))
- ✅ Add URL's **Use authorization** shows the login Options → Sites Logins has for the address, the
  one the download uses ([#511](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/511))
- ✅ Windows: closing the window hides MDM in the notification area again, its icon among the hidden
  ones behind ^ too; the window stays in the taskbar only when Windows says it has no icon of MDM's
  ([#750](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/750),
  [#718](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/718),
  [#754](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/754),
  [#545](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/545),
  [#534](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/534),
  [#527](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/527))
- ✅ The window no longer freezes while Explorer is slow to answer about MDM's notification-area
  icon: it is asked beside the window
  ([#747](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/747))
- ✅ Two tests that failed now and then on busy CI runners: the slow-flush one measures the transfer,
  not the runner's disk, and the crash-and-resume one found a real delay in saving a new download's
  progress, fixed too ([#518](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/518))
- ✅ The window no longer waits while Windows takes seconds to look up the time zone for the queues'
  schedules ([#536](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/536))
- ✅ Video look-ups no longer fail with "WinError 448 ... untrusted mount point" when a folder on
  PATH goes through a junction Windows won't let yt-dlp cross
  ([#508](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/508))
- ✅ Dailymotion's embedded player from the browser's button: looked up without the embedding site's
  Referer, which Dailymotion refused
  ([#359](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/359))
- ✅ A magnet link handed over while Add torrent is already open waits its turn instead of being
  dropped ([#507](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/507))
- ✅ No freeze when a video finishes: its file is marked as downloaded from the web beside the window
  ([#510](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/510))
- ✅ Linux: Dark Mode support on window managers such as Hyprland and sway, which often have no
  desktop portal to say dark or light: GNOME's setting is read
  ([#324](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/324))
- ✅ No bright white line under the menu bar in dark mode
  ([#379](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/379))
- ✅ The Download video window remembers the folder you saved into
  ([#475](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/475))
- ✅ Download video says in plain words when a site's bot check (Cloudflare) refuses yt-dlp (part of
  [#317](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/317))
- ✅ Google Colab: only its tokenized runtime-proxy transfers stay with the browser; ordinary
  notebook links can still be taken
  ([#603](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/603))
- ✅ A gofile share link says it is a web page to open in the browser, instead of saving the page as
  the file ([#346](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/346))
- ✅ Export and Import for the sites the download button stays off (part of
  [#424](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/424))
- ✅ Videos in the progress window: no percentage when the size isn't known, and the real file size
  at the end
- ✅ X (Twitter) videos from the media list are named after the tab instead of a random file name
  (part of [#493](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/493))
- ✅ Windows: **Open folder** uses the file manager set up to open folders, not always Explorer
  ([#446](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/446))

## Being worked on

These ship in a later version, when they're ready.

### Being built

- 🔄 Linux, what's left ([#164](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/164)):
  screen readers (Orca) reading MDM's windows; browsers installed as a Flatpak (Firefox from
  Flathub may reach MDM through the desktop, as the Snap does: to check); native Wayland windows
  (`MDM_WAYLAND=1`) placing their menus, which needs popup windows the window library doesn't
  have yet, so XWayland stays the default; Vulkan as the default renderer (below)
- 🔄 The Safari extension (in 0.5.2): still to check in Safari itself, signed with a Developer ID

### Bugs being looked into

- 🔍 The main window's own looks at the disk on a drive slow to answer: starting or resuming a
  download that was already under way, a rename or move when one finishes, and links added
  without Download File Info still wait for it (follows
  [#743](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/743))
- 🔍 Alt and F10 not reaching the menu bar while a screen reader (NVDA, Narrator) runs
  ([#328](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/328)): 0.5.2's fix covers a
  focused control, not this
- 🔍 A site's bot check refusing MDM's request (testfile.org, a Cloudflare challenge): the
  message now says so ([#376](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/376)); a
  way to hand the download back to the browser is still to decide
- 🔍 A 10-second freeze of the window after a night left open
  ([#304](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/304)): most likely the
  computer waking from sleep; waiting on the reporter's full report

## Planned

### Look and performance

- 📋 Vulkan the default on Linux and Metal on macOS, once real graphics cards have tried them (AMD,
  Intel and NVIDIA, X11 and Wayland, older cards without Vulkan)
  ([#206](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/206))
- 📋 Benchmarks against other download managers
  ([#71](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/71))
