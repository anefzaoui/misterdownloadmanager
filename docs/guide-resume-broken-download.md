# Tutorial: resume a broken download

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

A download that stopped halfway doesn't have to start over. MDM keeps what it has and continues from there.

## After a cut connection

When the connection drops, MDM retries on its own. In the progress window, the connection table shows **Retrying** and the reason. Usually the download goes on by itself once the connection is back.

If it gives up and shows **Error**:

1. Select the download in the list.
2. Click **Resume** on the toolbar (or right-click → **Resume Download**).

## After a crash or a restart

MDM saves each download's progress as it goes, so a Windows crash, a power cut or closing MDM loses at most the last moments.

1. Start MDM. The download is in the list under **Unfinished**.
2. Select it and click **Resume**.

## When the link has expired

Many sites hand out links that only work for a while, or only while you are signed in. Resuming then fails, because the old address no longer answers.

1. Right-click the download and choose **Refresh download address**.
2. MDM opens the web page the link came from (when it knows it), and the download's **File Properties**.
3. On the web page, start the download again, or copy the new download link (right-click → **Copy link**). If the browser hands the new download to MDM, cancel it there: you only need the address.
4. Paste the new link into **Address** in **File Properties** and click **OK**.
5. Click **Resume**. The download continues from where it stopped, using the new address.

The new address has to point at the same file. If it doesn't, MDM stops with **the file changed on the server**.

## When the file changed on the server

If the site replaced the file with a new version, the parts MDM has don't fit any more. Right-click the download and choose **Redownload** to start again from the beginning. A finished file is only replaced when the new download completes.

## When resuming isn't possible

Look at **Resume capability** in the progress window. **No** means the server can't send a file in parts. MDM then uses one connection, and a download that stops has to start over. For such servers, avoid stopping the download, and avoid a very low speed limit, which can make the server drop the connection.
