# Portable mode

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

The portable copy of MDM runs from any folder, including a USB stick, without installing anything.

## How it works

`MisterDownloadManager-<version>-portable.zip` holds the same programs as the setup, plus a folder named `data` next to `misterdownloadmanager.exe`. When that folder is there and MDM can write to it, MDM is in portable mode:

- The download list, settings, helpers for video (yt-dlp, ffmpeg) and torrent data are kept in `data`, not in your Windows profile.
- Nothing is written to the registry.

Delete the `data` folder (or make it read-only) and the same copy behaves like the plain zip: it keeps its data in `%APPDATA%\misterdownloadmanager`.

## Set it up

1. Download `MisterDownloadManager-<version>-portable.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/releases).
2. Unzip it where you want MDM to live, for example `E:\MDM` on a USB stick.
3. Run `misterdownloadmanager.exe` from there.

On the first start MDM asks for the language; see [Languages](languages.md).

## What is different

- **Downloads still go to the computer's Downloads folder** unless you change it. To keep them with MDM, set each category's folder in **Options → Save to**. [Carry MDM on a USB stick](guide-usb-stick.md) shows how.
- **Launch Mister Download Manager on startup** in **Options → General** is greyed: starting with Windows needs the registry.
- **Browser integration needs the installer.** The browser finds MDM's helper through the registry, so a portable copy can't take downloads from the browser. Use **Add URL**, the clipboard or the drop target instead (see [Adding downloads](adding-downloads.md)).
- **Tasks → Torrent settings → Open magnet links and .torrent files with Mister Download Manager** does write to the registry, for your Windows account only. Leave it off to keep the portable copy registry-free.

## Moving between computers

The list keeps each download's full folder path. If Windows gives the USB stick a different drive letter on another computer, check **Options → Save to**, and expect downloads saved under the old letter to be missing until the letter matches again. When MDM is about to save into a folder that doesn't exist, it asks whether to create it.

Quit MDM with **Tasks → Exit** before you unplug the stick, so it saves the list.
