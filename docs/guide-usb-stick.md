# Tutorial: carry MDM on a USB stick

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

The portable copy runs straight from a USB stick and keeps its list and settings there. With a few settings, it saves your downloads to the stick too.

## 1. Put MDM on the stick

1. Download `MisterDownloadManager-<version>-portable.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/releases).
2. Unzip it onto the stick, for example to `E:\MDM`.
3. Check that there is a `data` folder next to `misterdownloadmanager.exe`. That folder is what makes MDM portable. Don't delete it.
4. Run `misterdownloadmanager.exe` and pick your language.

## 2. Save downloads to the stick

By default, downloads go to the Downloads folder of the computer you're using. To keep them on the stick:

1. Open **Downloads → Options** and the **Save to** tab.
2. Under **Category**, choose **General**.
3. In **Default download directory for "General" category**, click **Browse** and choose a folder on the stick, for example `E:\Downloads`.
4. Choose the next category (**Compressed**, **Documents**, **Music**, **Programs**, **Video**, **Torrents**) and do the same, for example `E:\Downloads\Video`.
5. Click **OK**.

## 3. Use it

- Add downloads with **Add URL**, the clipboard (**Options → General → Offer to download links copied to the clipboard**) or the drop target (**Tasks → Show drop target**).
- The browser extension can't send downloads to a portable copy, because that needs the installer.
- Before you unplug the stick, quit MDM with **Tasks → Exit** so it saves everything. Closing the window only hides it in the tray.

## On another computer

Windows may give the stick another drive letter, such as `F:` instead of `E:`. The folders you set, and the downloads already in the list, still point at the old letter. Check **Options → Save to** and change the folders if needed. When MDM is about to save into a folder that doesn't exist, it asks whether to create it.
