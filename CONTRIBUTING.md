# Contributing

Thanks for helping with Mister Download Manager. Bug reports, ideas, translation fixes and pull
requests are all welcome.

## Getting set up

You need Windows 10 or 11 and Rust stable 1.95 or later (the MSVC toolchain).

```
cargo build
cargo run -p mdm-app
```

To try changes without touching your own downloads, give the app a separate data folder:

```
set MDM_DATA_DIR=C:\some\empty\folder
cargo run -p mdm-app
```

`cargo run -p mdm-labserver -- --faults "rate=2M"` starts a local test server that serves
generated files with whatever trouble you ask for (slow connections, cuts, busy answers, no
ranges; `GET /` lists them), so downloads can be tested without the internet.

## Before you open a pull request

These are the checks CI runs; each works on a clean clone:

```
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
python tools/i18n/extract.py      # then: git diff --exit-code i18n/en.tsv
node tools/extension/test.mjs
```

Keep changes focused and match the code around them. A few rules hold everywhere:

- **Clean room.** MDM contains no code, binaries, artwork, icons, sounds or text from Internet
  Download Manager or any other download manager. Never disassemble, decompile or patch another
  program, and never bypass anyone's licensing. See
  [Not a reverse-engineering project](README.md#not-a-reverse-engineering-project).
- **Every text the user sees goes through `crate::i18n`** (`t`, `tc`, `tn`, `fmt`); after adding
  one, run `python tools/i18n/extract.py`. Data inside a sentence (a file name, an address, a
  size) goes in through `i18n::ltr` or `i18n::isolate`, so it reads right in right-to-left
  languages.
- **Windows-only calls live in `crates/app/src/win32.rs`**, their Linux and macOS counterparts
  in `unix.rs`; the rest of the workspace is safe, portable Rust (`unsafe_code = "deny"`).
  On Windows, `tools\dev\check-cross.ps1` checks that it still builds for Linux and macOS.
- **Fix causes, not cases**, and keep producers and consumers of shared data (the download list,
  the browser extension's messages, the catalogs) in step.

## Translations

The interface is in every language Windows 11 offers. The catalogs in [`i18n/`](i18n) were made
by machine translation, and each row marked `#, machine` waits for a native speaker:

1. Open `i18n/<code>.tsv` (the codes are in [`i18n/languages.tsv`](i18n/languages.tsv)).
2. Fix the translation in the row's third column and delete its `#, machine` line.
3. Keep `{placeholders}` and the one `&` (the keyboard shortcut letter) as they are.

`cargo test -p mdm-app every_catalog` checks every catalog. To see whether your texts fit, set
`MDM_FIT_AUDIT` to a file and take the screenshots in your language
(`tools\lab\docs-shots.ps1 ... -Lang <code>`): every text that runs past its window or over
another one is listed there. See [Languages](docs/languages.md)
for how the language list, the installer and the right-to-left layout fit together.

## Reporting problems

Use **Help → Report a problem** in the app: it opens the bug report form with your version,
system, how MDM was installed and its language filled in. The form asks for the same when you
open it yourself. Security problems: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
