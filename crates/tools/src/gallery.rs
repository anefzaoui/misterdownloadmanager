//! gallery-dl (#58): image galleries (Wikimedia Commons, Flickr, DeviantArt, Pixiv…) as yt-dlp
//! is for video pages. An optional helper, installed the same way: a release from its own page
//! (Codeberg), its `SHA256SUMS` checked against its author's OpenPGP key (pinned in
//! `keys/gallery-dl.asc`), the program against that list, kept in `tools/gallery-dl/<version>/`
//! with the previous version, never older; or the person's own copy (`chosen`). It runs in the
//! same job as yt-dlp does (`proc::spawn`), so Stop and MDM's end take it and all it started.
//!
//! A download is a folder: gallery-dl prints each file it saves (one path a line, `# path` for
//! one already there), and skips what is already there when started again, so a gallery started
//! again fetches only its new images.
//!
//! MDM's engine downloads the files (#769): gallery-dl first lists each one, its address and the
//! path it would save it to (`--print prepare-after:…`, nothing downloaded), the engine brings
//! them in several at once into those paths, under the speed limits, and gallery-dl then runs as
//! before: it finds them there and fetches only what the engine couldn't have (a site that wants
//! headers of its own, a sign-in). A gallery-dl too old to list them (before 1.32) downloads them all
//! itself, as before.
