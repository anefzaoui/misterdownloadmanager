//! A video download run by yt-dlp under supervision: our file name, progress read from a fixed
//! `--progress-template`, the final path from `--print after_move`. Stopping kills it; starting
//! again continues (`--continue`). Each run takes the page as looked up (`-J`), points links at
//! servers that answer ([`crate::servers`]) and downloads from that list (`--load-info-json`),
//! so a run reads the page once. A run looks the page up afresh, except the first run of a
//! download chosen in the browser's quality menu, which takes the look-up the menu was made from
//! ([`Preloaded`]): the page is then read once for the menu and the download together.
//!
//! The bytes come down through MDM's engine (#769, [`crate::streams`]): yt-dlp chooses the
//! formats, the engine downloads each stream into the file yt-dlp looks for, then yt-dlp merges
//! them, saves the subtitles and the metadata as after its own download. What the engine can't
//! download (a live stream, RTMP…) yt-dlp downloads itself, as before.
