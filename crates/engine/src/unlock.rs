//! Downloads through a service account (#44, debrid services such as Real-Debrid): a file host's
//! link is turned, through the service's API and the user's own account, into a direct link the
//! engine then downloads as any file (every connection, resume). The engine knows nothing of
//! accounts: the app gives a download an [`Unlocker`] (`Options::unlocker`), asked before the
//! first request, and again when the direct link stops working (it lives minutes or hours).
//!
//! The direct link is never shown and never leaves the download: the list, "Copy address" and
//! the event log keep the host's link (the event log names only the direct link's server).
