//! One download: probe, parallel connections driven by the planner, positional writes, progress.
//!
//! The first connection is also the probe: a plain `GET` (no Range, as IDM does — D-007) that
//! keeps streaming from byte 0 while further connections split the file (notes/ENGINE.md §1).
//! Range support is learned from the first range answer: 206 confirms it; 200 means the server
//! ignores ranges, so the file goes back to the probe connection alone.
//! One HTTP/1.1 client per download, shared by its connections: one pool (keep-alive sockets
//! reused between segments, TLS sessions resumed) with at most `connections()` requests at a
//! time, since each worker has one request in flight.
