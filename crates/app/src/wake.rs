//! Scheduler → "Wake the computer to run this queue" (#142): the computer, asleep, is woken
//! shortly before a queue's start time, and kept awake while that queue runs.
//!
//! The times are worked out here, the same on every system; the waking itself is the system's:
//! - Windows: a waitable timer that resumes the computer (`win32::wake_at`), owned by MDM's
//!   process, as the Scheduler's starts are (MDM has to be running, in the tray if need be).
//!   Windows' power options must allow wake timers; when they don't, the Scheduler says so.
//! - Linux: the clock chip's wake alarm (`/sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm`), which only an
//!   administrator may set unless they let users set it (the guide shows how). A systemd user
//!   timer can't wake the system (`WakeSystem=` needs the system manager), nor can `rtcwake`
//!   or a timer on an alarm clock without root or CAP_WAKE_ALARM.
//! - macOS: `pmset schedule wake` and IOKit's scheduled power events need an administrator;
//!   MDM never asks for one by itself, so the option says why.
//!
//! While a queue with the option runs, the computer is kept from sleeping (Windows: a power
//! request; Linux: logind's sleep and idle inhibitor; macOS: `caffeinate`), so a computer woken
//! for it doesn't fall asleep again before the downloads are done. Afterwards the system's own
//! sleep settings apply again, and the queue's "Turn off computer when done" can put it to
//! sleep at once.
