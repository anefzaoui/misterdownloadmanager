//! What draws the windows (#89, #206): OpenGL (eframe's glow), or the system's own graphics API
//! through eframe's wgpu with that one backend only ([`GPU`]): Direct3D 12 on Windows, Vulkan on
//! Linux (Wayland and X11 windows alike), Metal on macOS. View → Draw with picks one, from the
//! next start. Windows draws with Direct3D by default (#89); Linux and macOS keep OpenGL by
//! default until Vulkan and Metal have clean reports from real graphics cards (#206), as
//! Direct3D had before it became Windows' default.
//!
//! The windows always open: when the chosen way can't start (no driver for it, a virtual
//! machine, Remote Desktop), the other is tried, and the reason is logged. A start with the
//! system's API that ends before its first frame (a crash or a kill inside the driver) is
//! remembered, and so is one whose first frame doesn't come within [`FIRST_FRAME_WITHIN`] (MDM
//! starts again, with OpenGL): the next starts draw with OpenGL until that API is chosen again,
//! and View → Draw with says why. A graphics card lost while MDM runs (a driver update or reset)
//! starts MDM again; a second loss soon after counts as the API failing. The same code does all
//! of this on every system: only [`GPU`] and the backend in `gpu::options` differ.
//!
//! An OpenGL that starts but can't draw MDM ([`gl_unfit`]: on Windows, one older than 3.0, #835)
//! is passed over too: MDM starts again with the system's API, on a software renderer when no
//! card has it (WARP), and remembers it, so the next starts go straight there, with OpenGL as the
//! last way, and View → Draw with says why.
//!
//! Testing overrides, in this order: `/renderer <name>` on the command line, then
//! `MDM_RENDERER=<name>`. Names: `opengl` (`gl`); `direct3d` (`d3d`) on Windows, `vulkan` (`vk`)
//! on Linux, `metal` on macOS, or `gpu` for whichever this system has; `warp` (Windows),
//! `vulkan-software` (`lavapipe`, Linux) or `software`: the system's API drawn by a software
//! renderer (Microsoft's WARP, Mesa's lavapipe), as on a computer without a graphics driver.
//! Another system's name is ignored. Off-screen test copies also take `MDM_TEST_GL_VERSION=2.1`:
//! the version OpenGL says it is, as an old card's driver does.
