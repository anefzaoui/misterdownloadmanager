//! Link grabber (#37): the links of a page (the browser's "Download all links"), of a list file
//! (Tasks → Import), copied (Tasks → Add batch download from clipboard, #709), dropped or
//! pasted, gathered into packages to tick before they are added. An address that came on its own
//! and turns out to be a web page is read for its links, which join as that page's (#705).
//! It grew out of the Import window and keeps its ways (IDM's "Download all links": every link
//! looked up for its name and size, Check all / Uncheck all, "Hide web pages", OK adds the
//! ticked ones to the queue); the packages come from JDownloader's link grabber: a split
//! archive's volumes are one package, the other links of one page another, the rest "Various
//! files". A package has its folder, an archive password and "Extract when done".
