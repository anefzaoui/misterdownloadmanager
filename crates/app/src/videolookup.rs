//! The browser's quality menu over a video (the extension's button, crates/nmhost): MDM looks
//! the video up with yt-dlp on a thread of its own and answers at once with a token
//! (`video_lookup`); the browser asks how it goes (`video_poll`) and sends the choice made there
//! (`video_pick`), a place in the list MDM offered, which MDM downloads with its own selector for
//! it and the look-up's own browser context.
//!
//! Faster than a look-up and a download each running yt-dlp on the page:
//! - an HLS stream's playlist MDM can read exactly as yt-dlp would is read by MDM itself
//!   (`mdm_tools::manifest`), and its qualities offered a second and more sooner; yt-dlp looks
//!   it up at the same time, for the download;
//! - yt-dlp's look-up is kept as it answered (`InfoSlot`), and the download chosen from it
//!   starts from it instead of reading the page again (`mdm_tools::video::Preloaded`);
//! - a second click on the same video, with exactly the same browser context, shares the first
//!   one's look-up while it runs or once it found the video ([`Lookups::share`]).
//!
//! Nothing else is shared between look-ups (a private window's never meets another's, a failure
//! is never reused), and none is kept past 10 minutes.
