//! Extracting archives when their download completes (#37): a Link grabber package's that says
//! so, or every archive with Options → Archives → "Extract archives when their download
//! completes"; and right-click → Extract on a finished one. A split archive waits for its last
//! volume. One archive at a time, on a thread of its own (mdm-extract does the work, into a
//! staging folder, so a failure leaves only the archive); each extracted file is marked as
//! downloaded from the archive's site, as the archive is. Afterwards the archive goes to the
//! Recycle Bin (the Trash) only when its package or Options says so.
//!
//! Every archive is tried without a password first. Only one that turns out to need one is
//! tried with its package's password, then with each of Options → Archives → Archive passwords
//! in turn, and only then is its password asked. A password that opened it moves to the top of
//! that list, as does one typed with "Remember it" (unticked at first). 7-Zip gets each one on
//! its standard input, never on its command line (mdm-extract).
