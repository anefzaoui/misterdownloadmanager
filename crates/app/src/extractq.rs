//! Extracting archives when their download completes (#37): a Link grabber package's that says
//! so, or every archive with Options → Archives → "Extract archives when their download
//! completes"; and right-click → Extract on a finished one. A split archive waits for its last
//! volume. One archive at a time, on a thread of its own (mdm-extract does the work, into a
//! staging folder, so a failure leaves only the archive); each extracted file is marked as
//! downloaded from the archive's site, as the archive is. Afterwards the archive goes to the
//! Recycle Bin (the Trash) only when its package or Options says so.
