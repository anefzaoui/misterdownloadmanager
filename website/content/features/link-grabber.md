## Links from anywhere

Right-click a page in the browser for **Download all links with Mister Download Manager**, or
select part of it for **Download selected links with Mister Download Manager**. The page's referrer and cookies go with each
link. You can also import a text file or an `.ef2` export with **Tasks → Import**, drop a list on
the download list, or open **Tasks → Link grabber...** and paste any text with **Ctrl+V**: every
web address in it is added.

A link that is already in your download list goes under **Already in the list**, unticked.

## Sorted into packages

The volumes of one split archive (`movie.part1.rar`, `movie.part2.rar` and so on) form one
package, the other links of a page another, and the rest go into **Various files**. Tick a
package to take all its links. Each package has its own folder, an archive password, and
**Extract when done**.

**Start** adds the ticked links to the **Main download queue** and starts it; **Add to queue**
adds them without starting.

## Checked before you download

As links arrive, MDM asks each server about its file, a few at a time. Each link then shows its
real name and size, and whether it is **Online**, **Offline (404)**, **Needs a login** or
**Busy, try later**. Offline links come unticked, so you don't queue what isn't there. Links to
web pages are hidden by default.

Some file hosts count a look-up as a download: turn the look-ups off in **Options → Archives**.

## Archives unpacked when they arrive

![Options on its Archives page: extracting archives when they are downloaded, and Link grabber's look-ups](images/help/options-archives.webp)
*Options → Archives: extract every archive, or only the packages that ask.*

MDM extracts ZIP (encrypted ones too), TAR, TAR.GZ, TAR.XZ, GZ and XZ itself. 7z and RAR need
7-Zip, a free program: RAR's own extraction code can't be part of a free program like MDM. When
7-Zip isn't installed, a window says so, with a button to get it.

A split archive is extracted once its last volume is in. Extraction is careful: a name that
would lead outside the folder is left out, an archive that would fill the disk stops first, and
an existing file is never overwritten. The archive itself goes to the Recycle Bin only when you
ask.
