## No connection sits idle

MDM opens 8 connections by default, and you can set anything from 1 to 32 in **Options →
Connection**. When a connection finishes its part, it takes over half of the largest part still
left, so the work is shared out again and again until the file is done. A connection that falls
far behind the others is dropped and opened again.

The progress window draws it as it happens: a bar of the whole file with each connection's
start and progress, and a table with what every connection is doing right now.

## Measured, not claimed

On the same PC and the same test server, MDM fetched a 1 GiB file in 1.0 s against IDM 6.42's
5.5 s, and a 256 KiB file in 0.03 s against 3.1 s: the medians of alternating runs. The
[benchmark page](/benchmark.html) has every run, the method and the raw data.

More connections help only where a server sends each one at a limited speed. Most servers allow
a few connections per address, and MDM notices when one says no: it stops asking that server
for more and lists what it learned under **Exceptions** in **Options → Connection**. You can set
a number for a server yourself there too.

## More than 32, if you want them

<!--@coming 0.5-->

**Allow more than 32 connections** in **Options → Connection** raises the limit to 128 per
download, for server exceptions too. The command line's `-c` takes 1 to 128.

## Resume that survives a crash

MDM saves how far each part has got as it goes. A download picks up where it stopped after you
pause it, after the connection drops, or after Windows or MDM itself crashes. A connection that
fails is retried on its own, and the table shows **Retrying** with the reason.

Before it continues, MDM checks that the file on the server is still the same one, so a changed
file never gets stitched onto an old half. When a server can't send a file in parts, the
progress window says **Resume capability: No** before you rely on it.

## Straight to disk

Each connection writes directly into the file's place on disk, in a part file next to the
final one. There is no temporary folder and no joining step at the end: when the last part
arrives, MDM checks the size and renames the file.
