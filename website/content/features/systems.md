## Windows: three ways to have it

On 64-bit Windows 10 and 11, MDM is the stable, recommended build. The [download
page](/download.html) offers three files:

- **The installer** (`setup.exe`), the one to pick unless you have a reason not to. It installs
  for you alone without administrator rights, or for everyone, and can set up browser
  integration and open `.torrent` files and magnet links with MDM.
- **The portable copy** (`portable.zip`), which runs from any folder.
- **The plain zip** (`x64.zip`), the same programs without an installer.

**Help → Check for updates → Update now** downloads a new version, checks its signature, puts it
in place and restarts, for the setup and both zips.

## Portable: everything in one folder

Unzip the portable copy anywhere, a USB stick included. The download list, the settings, the
video helpers and torrent data stay in a `data` folder next to the program, and nothing is
written to the registry. Two things need the installer instead: starting with Windows, and
taking downloads from the browser, since both go through the registry. [Carry MDM on a USB
stick](guide-usb-stick.md) shows the set-up.

## Mac and Linux: what you get today

Today's files marked `-experimental` are for macOS 11 and later, on Apple Silicon or Intel, and
for Linux on x86-64: an AppImage for most distributions, a `.deb` for Ubuntu, Debian, Mint and
Pop!_OS, an `.rpm` for Fedora, openSUSE and RHEL, and a `.tar.gz` of the plain programs. Please
[tell us how it went](https://github.com/anefzaoui/misterdownloadmanager/issues/new/choose), good
or bad.

There, MDM connects itself to your browsers at each start, has its tray icon, follows the
system's light or dark look and uses the system's fonts and ffmpeg. The Mac app isn't notarized
by Apple yet, so macOS asks before its first start: right-click it and choose **Open** (on
macOS 15 and later, **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**). A `.deb` or `.rpm`
update opens in the system's installer. A few parts work only on Windows, and the help says so
where it matters.

## Linux, checked on four desktops

<!--@coming 0.5-->

Linux won't be experimental any more: every change is now checked on a Linux desktop as well as
on Windows. GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce and Cinnamon were checked window by window: the tray icon and
its menu, **Minimize to the notification area**, Dark Mode support following the desktop, and the
browsers handing downloads over (Ubuntu's Snap Firefox, Google Chrome and Brave). A Wayland
session runs MDM through XWayland, so menus open under their titles, on tiling compositors such
as sway too. The `.deb` and `.rpm` were installed in clean Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12 and Fedora 45
systems and bring everything MDM needs; from the AppImage or the `.tar.gz`, a missing library is
named at start with the command that installs it. **Update now** asks the package manager which
package MDM is.

What's left: the Flatpak Firefox isn't checked yet; screen readers (Orca) don't read MDM's
windows on Linux yet; and native Wayland windows can't place menus, so XWayland stays the
default. macOS stays experimental: its builds are made and tested by GitHub Actions, not yet on a
Mac of ours.

## Smaller Mac downloads, lighter Linux updates

<!--@coming 0.5-->

The Mac gets two smaller downloads, one for Apple Silicon and one for Intel, instead of one
universal `.dmg` of 80 MB. From 0.2.4 or older, update the Mac once by hand: **Download** in
**Check for updates** opens the release, where you pick your Mac's file. The AppImage can update
through AppImageLauncher, Gear Lever and AppImageUpdate, which fetch only the parts that changed.
Linux can draw with Vulkan and macOS with Metal, from **View → Draw with**, while OpenGL stays the
default there. In a Wayland session, MDM runs through XWayland so its menus open where you click.
