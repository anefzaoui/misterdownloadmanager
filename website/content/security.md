## Report a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private **[Report a vulnerability]({{REPO}}/security/advisories/new)** form. Only the maintainers can read it. Say what you found, how to reproduce it, and which version you used (**Help → About** shows it). Please don't open a public issue for security problems.

You'll get an answer as soon as possible. A fix is released before the details are made public, and you're credited in the advisory and the release notes unless you'd rather not be. During the 0.x versions, only the latest release gets security fixes.

## How releases are made

- Every release is built from the public source code by **GitHub Actions**, on GitHub's servers; the build logs are public.
- Each release lists the **SHA-256** checksum of every file in `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Check your download against it: see [Download](/download.html#check-your-download).
- Get MDM **only from this site or the project's GitHub releases**. Copies elsewhere may be altered.
- The Windows installer isn't code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn before the first start. Code signing will be added.

## What protects you

- **Helpers are verified before they run.** yt-dlp is checked against its developers' signing key, and ffmpeg against its published checksums.
- **Nothing listens on the network.** The automation API is off by default and, when on, answers only on `127.0.0.1` with a secret token. The browser helper answers only MDM's own extension.
- **Downloaded file names are cleaned** before they become paths, so a server can't write outside the folder you chose.
- **Credentials stay with their site.** Logins and cookies are sent only to the host they belong to, even across redirects.
- **No telemetry**: see the [privacy policy](/privacy.html).

The technical policy, with the code each point refers to, is in [SECURITY.md]({{REPO}}/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
